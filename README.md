# Machine_Learning-Stanford-
This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments for the  Machine Learning Course by Stanford University on Coursera.

# Motivation
This course has so far been the gold standard for all Machine Learning Practitioners in the world. The in depth concept building from Andrew Ng's lectures was the goal while taking on this course.

# Tech/ Framework Used
[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)


# How to use?
Open Octave/ MATLAB. You could also make an account on MATLAB online.

Clone repository in your system.

Go to File Explorer and set the folder as the current directory.

Run the algorithm by clicking the play button in the editor.

# Project Status
The is done along with the 12 week course and I have received a completion certificate for it already.
However, the intention of this repository is just to provide a reference to anybody stuck with the assignments. Before blindly copy pasting the solution in your assignments while doing the course would be a bread of ethics and Coursera's code of honor as well.
